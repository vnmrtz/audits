# Audit Experience

## About vnmrtz
vnmrtz is an experienced security researcher and the Co-Founder and Lead Security Researcher at Enigma Dark, where they lead efforts in smart contract security for protocols such as Euler Finance, Aave, Silo Finance, Flower Money, and TapiocaDAO. vnmrtz specializes in smart contract auditing fuzz testing, and invariant testing, improving the security of decentralized EVM-based smart contract systems.

In addition to his work at Enigma Dark, vnmrtz serves as a Security Researcher at Spearbit and has contributed as a Smart Contract Auditor at Oak Security and Solidified, contributing to the security of complex and high-profile DeFi codebases.

With dedicated focus on fuzz testing and invariant research, vnmrtz has created the **largest number of fuzzing suites developed by any security researcher**. As a leading fuzzing expert, he has played a key role in advancing smart contract fuzz testing across the entire ecosystem. vnmrtz developed the **Enigma Dark Invariant Framework** and has collaborated with major protocols to design and implement over **10 customized testing suites** that uncover edge cases and enhance protocol security.

Since beginning his white-hat journey in 2021, vnmrtz has uncovered and resolved critical vulnerabilities in leading protocols like AAVE and RAI, protecting over $33M in live assets.
